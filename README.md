# GGpoker Payout Creator
Convert payout from PokerCraft to HRC json file so you don't need to type them manually.

## How to Use
1. Input the Tournament Name & Total Chips and copy the structure from PokerCraft.  
    (Find the tournament you are interested in, then copy all lines from the first to the last position, including all rank and payout)
2. Select the path where you want to save the file and click "Save to JSON file".
3. Load the JSON file in Hand Setup or import it to the Structure Manager in HRC.

Don't forget to double-check that the payout is correct. There might be some unresolved bugs that I have not yet discovered.
